# Facebook Ads Metrics dbt Package ([Docs](https://housewarehq.github.io/dbt_facebook_ads_metrics))

#Pre-Reqs!
For the package to work, you need to import ```basic ad``` report while ETLing Ad data with Fivetran

# üì£ What does this dbt package do?
This package provides pre-built metrics for Facebook ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook_ads#schemainformation).

This package enables you to access commonly used metrics on top of Facebook Ads Data

## Metrics 

This package contains transformed models built on top of [Facebook_ads_source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads_source). A dependency on the source packages is declared in this package's `packages.yml` file, so it will automatically download when you run `dbt deps`. 

The metrics offered by this package are described below.
Note that all the metrics contain extended metrics for segmentation based on campaigns and adsets.

# üéØ How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran Facebook Ads connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.


## Step 2: Install the package

Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - git: "https://github.com/HousewareHQ/dbt_facebook_ads_metrics.git"
    revision: v0.1.0
```

## Step 3: Define database and schema variables

By default, this package will look for your Facebook Ads data in the `fivetran_facebook_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Facebook Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  facebook_ads_database: your_database_name
  facebook_ads_schema: your_schema_name
```

For additional configurations for the source models, please visit the [Facebook Ads source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads_source).

## (Optional) Step 4: Change build schema
By default this package will build the Facebook Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_facebook_ads`) and the Facebook Ads metrics within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_facebook_ads_metrics`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Intercom data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  facebook_ads_metrics:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  facebook_ads_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
